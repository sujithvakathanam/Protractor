Fix version: To be filled depending on the release
Label: To be filled depending on if it is a UI or Backend or Operator issue(If its a regression bug, Please use the label as 'Regression')

Description:
Whenever an error occurs I should expect that the UI to have some error handling and expose a user friendly error to the user. Instead the only way to find out if there is an error is by scanning the browser console when performing an action.

Test Steps:
Login to Hydra
Load the Fenics app
Open and monitor the browser console
Upload a .tsv file ( with an incorrect format )
Confirm that an error is raised in the console indicating that .tsv file format was invalid.
